# airpollution

This repository provides hourly air pollution datasets collected from five monitoring stations in Eskişehir, Türkiye, between 2024 and 2025.  
The data was obtained from the Turkish Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change | National Air Quality Monitoring Network.

We also provide modified datasets where 10%, 15%, 20%, and 25% of the values were artificially removed to simulate different missing data scenarios.
